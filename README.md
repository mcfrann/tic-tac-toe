## Abstract

  Grab a friend and play Tic-Tac-Toe on this neon-themed gameboard!
The emphasis of this project was to utilize the skills I've gathered over the last two months during Mod 1 at Turing. This webpage was built completely from scratch and taught me about my strengths and weaknesses in JavaScript logic and problem solving. It also exercised some of my very basic, but growing, HTML and CSS skills which I found to be very fun.

## Technologies
  - JavaScript
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Code Architecture
  The code for this project includes one main.js file for DOM manipulation, two class files (Game.js & Player.js) that hold the Data Model, an HTML file, and a CSS file.

## Wins
  - I was really excited to have creative liberty and push my styling skills in this project. I worked to learn how to use PNGs as icons and they worked effectively in the innerHTML of my game and overall made a webpage that I am very proud of!
  - The JavaScript logic I came up with was different than that of some of the classmates I chatted with, but I remained confident in my method and was able to make it work after some refactoring. I'm very proud of myself for that!

## Challenges + Improvements
  - I was really good about pseudocoding at the beginning of my project, which was crucial, but once I started to hit some walls I didn't pseudocode when it would have actually been very beneficial. Want to work on implementing that more consistently in my upcoming projects.
  - I ran into some bugs with the heading not alternating players after the first game frustratingly enough after having created a fully playable game... I must have messed up a tiny detail in refactoring, which lead to an extra day of refactoring code and making sure the game was running smoothly again. Fortunately, this lead to less messy code blocks and more clear naming for my functions.
